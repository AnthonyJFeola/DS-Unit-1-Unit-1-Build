The epidemic of road crash fatalities and disabilities is gradually being recognized as a major public health concern.

To make sense of this tenacious epidemic, I dove into a countrywide car accident dataset, which covers 49 states of the United States. The data is collected from February 2016 to December 2019, using several data providers, including two APIs that provide streaming traffic incident data. These APIs broadcast traffic data captured by a variety of entities, such as the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road-networks. Using the 2018 data, I examined the accident severity categories as compared to mean temperature, as well as each causal weather condition. I was able to determine a slight correlation between average temperature and the severity of accidentsâ€”suggesting that more severe accidents are attributed to lower temperature. As for individual weather conditions, I made a shocking discovery: more than a third of all recorded U.S. accidents in 2018 occurred during clear weather conditions. Furthermore, I pulled 2018 state population data and compared it to the annual accidents of each state. The results were very supportive of the fact that larger state populations result in significantly more annual accidents.

After drawing conclusions based on state population, I furthered my analysis using a per capita basis by state. Since state population is a broad parameter, it does not account for those who reside in a state but do not drive, individuals who use mass transit to commute, or those who share a vehicle. With that said, per capita was a valuable analysis tool as it provides an average across a population as seen below:
