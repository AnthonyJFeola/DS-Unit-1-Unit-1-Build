* The direct download link for the dataset used is here: https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents/download. It is too big to upload to GitHub.
* Both the Population.xlsx and US_Accidents_2016_to_2019.csv must be imported prior to running the notebook. (Note: I renamed US_Accidents_2016_to_2019.csv locally from the original file name)
* Portfolio/Blog located here: https://anthonyjfeola.github.io/
